Hi! 👋 My name is Leonardo, I'm 22 years old and I'm passionate about software development, at the moment my interests are Linux, networking, distributed systems and automation of **anything** that I need to do more than 1 time.

I started as a developer, and along the way I ended up bumping into DevOps practices (IaaC, CI/CD...) that were an excellent gateway to the operations area. Currently I work as a systems administrator, delving into subjects such as operating systems and networks, but without giving up programming.

If you want to contact me, send me a message on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lsgalves?locale=en_US) or an [email](mailto:leonardosgalves@gmail.com). My public PGP key is [here](https://lsgalves.com/gpg.pub.asc).
